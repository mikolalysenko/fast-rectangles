## Fastest Rectangles

Some thoughts:

- How many rectangles can you draw in 5 seconds?
- What is the fastest way to draw them?

So maybe the Challenge:
- what's the fastest approach to draw 1 million rectangles?

Rules:
- Canvas or WebGL (three.js) may be used
- Stroke them
- Fill them
- Rectangle should be updatable by JS
- Rectangles are defined by (x, y, w, h)
- They are in units as fraction of the screen size (0..1)
